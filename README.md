My solutions for AOC 2022.

## How to run solutions

You will need:
- cargo
- rust (latest stable)
  
To execute a specific day:
 
```bash
cargo run --bin dayXX
```

To execute unit tests for a specific day:

```bash
cargo test --bin dayXX
```

To execute all unit tests (including lib):

```bash
cargo test
```
